# Simple-Day-Planner

## Overview

A simple 12 hour time block style management app. The focus of this project was to practice storing information to local storage an retrieving it when needed. The HTML document was not created dynamically. The page layout itself is a template. The current time down to seconds is displayed at the top of the page and the current hour is highlighted in red. Past hours are dark blue and future hours are light blue, giving you a fast look at where you are in the day. The schedule can be easily changed by writing in an agenda item and clicking the save button.

## How to use

* Write agenda items in appropriate time box.
* Click save button to the right of the time box. 
* Items will be repopulated when page loads if you need to close the app.


## Known Bugs

* Currently save buttons are not tied to the hour block they are attached to, meaning that pressing any save button on the page will save the schedule. 

## Features in Development

* Items on page will clear at the start of a new day.
